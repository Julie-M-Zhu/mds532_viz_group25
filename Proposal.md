# Description of the data
We will be visualizing the dataset of serious violent crime cases happened in 68 police jurisdictions over 40 years. This [city crime dataset](https://github.com/themarshallproject/city-crime) is contributed by Gabriel Dance, Tom Meagher, and Emily Hopkins from the Marshall Project. It contains 2829 entries. Each of the entries denotes a report of crimes happened in a specific location in a specific year. 

The column `ORI` is an identifier for each police jurisdiction and the column `department_name` is the name of the department. The column `total_pop` represents the number of residents living under the specific police jurisdiction. 

The dataset includes information about four types of major violent crimes: homicide, rape, robbery and aggravated assault. Column `violent_crime` is the total number of violent crimes happened and  `homs_sum`, `rape_sum`, `rob_sum` and `agg_ass_sum` are the number of crime cases of each of the categories respectively. Column `violent_per_100k` is the average number of violent crimes within every 100 thousands residents in that city.
